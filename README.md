### Visualization 1 
Create an overview of the relationships between countries so that it is possible to see who donates to whom and how much.
a) Who are the major donors and to which countries do they donate the most? And conversely, who are the major receivers and which countries do they receive from the most? 
b) Are there groups of countries that tend to donate/receive to/from a similar set of countries?

### Visualization 3
Considering only the top 5 purposes of donation:
a) How does the relationship between countries look like in terms of purposes? 
b) What purposes do countries donate for to other countries? 
c) Are there countries that donate to a given country using multiple purposes? Or do countries always donate using one single purpose when donating to another country?
